    "\n",
    "## Terms\n",
    "  * Model: an equation between one variable -the response- that you're trying to estimate and other variables that you can use to come up with estimation - called predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Model: $y = f(x_1,x_2,x_3,...)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression Model: $y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 +...$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression Model: $y= b_0 + b_1x_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of Linear Regression Model\n",
    "  * Linearity: mean of y is linearly determined by predictors\n",
    "  * Independence: with different X , responses are independent\n",
    "  * Normality: random noise and y follow normal distribution\n",
    "  * Equal variance: variance for y are all equal even if values of predictors are different\n",
    " \n",
    "Above assumptions must be validated if you want to make inferences using linear regression models. But if you just want to make predictions, you do not need to be strict about these assumptions for the most part\n",

    "# Applying Linear Regression Model to Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Population model : $ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * x_i + \\epsilon_i \\\\ \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)$\n",
    "  * $\\beta_0$: the intercept\n",
    "  * $\\beta_1$: the slope\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Equation : $ \\mu_{y|x_i} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * x_i $\n",
    "  * use sample pairs ($x_i,y_i$) to estimate population parameters: $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\sigma$\n",
    "  * the sample pairs on a scatter plot will not line up in straight line because there are multiple other factors that affect the response, besides whatever one predictor we chose for the simple linear regression model\n",
    "  * So, all the other factors will be pushed into a \"noise term\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ordinary Least Square Estimation: Estimating Population Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction Equation : $\\hat{y_i} = b_0 + b_1x_i$\n",
    "  * $b_0$: estimated value for $\\beta_0$\n",
    "  * $b_1$: estimated value for $\\beta_1$\n",
    "  * $\\epsilon_i$: the error, the shortest distance between the data point $(x_i,y_i)$ and the prediction equation line for given estimated values  \n",
    "  * minimization problem: need to find $b_0$ and $b_1$ that minimizes sum of squared errors: $ \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\epsilon_i^2$\n",
    "  * solving the minimization problem gives us the prediction equation that is **the best fit line**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ### Explicit formulas for estimated values\n",
