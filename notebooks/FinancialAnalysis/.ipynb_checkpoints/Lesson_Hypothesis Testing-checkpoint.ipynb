    "  * t-distribution has relatively fatter tails, but as sample size gets larger the shape of t-distribution will more closely resemble Z-distribution\n",
    "  * larger sample size means t-distribution has greater degrees of freedom where DoF = n - 1\n",
    "  * this is why at significantly high sample size, we can substitute sample mean s for population mean $\\mu$ in the above calculations\n",
